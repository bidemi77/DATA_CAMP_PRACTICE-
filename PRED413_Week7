# I Started Using the Same Dataset that i used last week and my goal is to add Garch model
into my analysis. Garch model is used to model volatility in the data which can be defined
as ...
 I am interested in univariate data therefore i have to remove other columns from the data 
 and simply use "closing prices" to build my models, perform forecast on them, and 
 examine their accuracy while looking at how it performs on test data.
 
 I converted the Dataset into Time Series data and here is the plot of the initial time 
 series.

 I fit the data into simple naive model just to see how the data performs with naive model.
 
 I went further to fit the data into ETS model, auto.arima model, and Arima(1,1,0)
 model
 
 Here is the RMSE MAE for the models which are variance metrics that are used to select
 best model.

            RMSE     MAE
ETS         0.89     0.59
auto.arima  0.78     0.59
arima(1,1,0)0.88     0.59


Applying GARCH model left my heart unGUARDED. I struggled with understanding how to get
the RMSE and MAE. I looked at expert students' code and see how they did it but i found 
their methods quite different from what i have in mind 



I applied Garch(1,1) to the residuals of the three models that i created. I used the results 
of the three models on the predict function in fGarch and was able to predict over the next 
2  periods. which yielded meanForecast for the three models.

                 meanForecast
pred_1           0.1688331
pred_2           0.1419778
pred_3           0.1708176 

pred_2 seems to produce better result than the rest of the predict functions.

I didn't understand the output that i got from Garchfit, i understand it is
a new concept to me. I am still learning while i am looking at other people codes to 
understand their thinking and see what i can learn from it. I  hope to GUARD my heart 
against being broken by GARCH.
